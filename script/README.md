# Data preprocessing
 In terms of preprocessing, we would need to complete several tasks:
- Firstly, we would need to handle entries with missing data fields, either by inputting a placeholder or removing the entry entirely.
- Secondly, we would need to clean up inconsistencies in the dataset—formatting, data types, etc.
- Thirdly, we would need to normalize numerical features such as funding goal, pledged amount, and number of backers.
- This normalization will ensure each feature is on a similar scale for analysis.
- Lastly, to aggregate Pederson’s dataset with McTeer’s, we would likewise need to standardrize feature names and remove duplicate entries.
