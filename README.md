# Crowdfunding Campaign Prediction

## Overview

This repository contains code and resources for a machine learning project aimed at predicting the success of crowdfunding campaigns. The project focuses on analyzing data from two major crowdfunding platforms, Kickstarter and Indiegogo, to develop predictive models using machine learning algorithms.

## Project Structure

- **data/**: This directory contains the datasets used in the analysis. It includes CSV files obtained from Kaggle for Kickstarter and Indiegogo campaigns.
- **scripts/**: This directory contains Python scripts used for data preprocessing, feature selection, model training, and evaluation.
- **README.md**: This file provides an overview of the project, its objectives, structure, and instructions for running the code.

## Dependencies

- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## Usage

Run the scripts in this order:

1. data_preprocessing.py
2. model_selection.py
3. model_tuning.py
4. model_evaluation.py
